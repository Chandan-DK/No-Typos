# No Typos 🎮

Hi! Welcome to the repository of my game No Typos.

This is a game made to help people who are new to touch typing.
<br/>Playing this game helps you build muscle memory of where 
<br/>each key is present on the keyboard which serves as the foundation for typing words and sentences. 

* Play the game here 👉 https://chandan-dk.itch.io/no-typos

<br/>**NOTE:** Please play the game in **Fullscreen Mode**

## Gameplay 🕹️

The game has moving cubes with characters written on it.
<br/>Your objective is to press the right key before the cube touches the barrier.
<br/>The cubes move faster and spawn more quickly up until a specific point.
<br/>If 3 characters touch the barriers the game is over.
<br/>Accomplish a good score and challenge yourself to surpass it!

## Devops ⚒️

I'm a devops enthusiast so I used Infrastructure as Code to host the game
<br/>

Following technologies were used: 
* AWS
* CodeBuild
* Docker
* Watchtower
* Terraform

For more information on the devops part please check the Terraform repository linked below. 
<br/>Separate repositories have been made for Terraform and the build files.
